   <p>We've stripped away everything that makes web design projects painful. No endless meetings. No content creation
    paralysis. No surprise costs. Just a straightforward path from your current website to one that actually works for
    your business.</p>

  <h2 class="section-title">The Three-Step Transformation</h2>

  <div class="process-steps">
   <div class="step">
    <div class="step-circle">1</div>
    <h3 class="step-title">Complete Content Capture</h3>
    <p>We begin by scraping every URL on your existing website. Every page, every paragraph, every detail you've already
     created gets preserved. This isn't just about saving text—it's about respecting the foundation you've built.</p>
    <div class="highlight-box">
     <p><strong>What this means for you:</strong> No content worksheets. No copywriting homework. No agonizing over what
      to say. Your existing content becomes our blueprint.</p>
    </div>
   </div>

   <div class="step">
    <div class="step-circle">2</div>
    <h3 class="step-title">Design DNA Analysis</h3>
    <p>Next, we identify your website's visual identity—color schemes, font styles, images, and design elements that
     make your site uniquely yours. We look beyond what's broken to find what's worth keeping.</p>
    <div class="highlight-box">
     <p><strong>What this means for you:</strong> Your website's personality remains intact. We're not imposing our
      style on your business; we're refining what's already there.</p>
    </div>
   </div>

   <div class="step">
    <div class="step-circle">3</div>
    <h3 class="step-title">Strategic Redesign & Delivery</h3>
    <p>Finally, we rebuild your website with better user experience while maintaining your site's essential character.
     This isn't a makeover—it's an evolution.</p>
    <div class="highlight-box">
     <p><strong>What this means for you:</strong> A website that feels familiar to you but works better for your
      prospects. Recognition without the frustration.</p>
